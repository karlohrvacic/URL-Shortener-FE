              In short: we collect only what the service needs to work. No ads, no tracking
              cookies, no third-party analytics. Visitor IP addresses are hashed immediately and
              deleted within 48 hours.

            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>
              hrva.cc is a non-commercial hobby project of{" "}
              <a href="https://hrva.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HrvaLabs.net</a>,
              operated by Karlo Hrvačić, who is the data controller within the meaning of
              Art. 4(7) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The service is provided
              free of charge and as is — see the <Link href="/terms">Terms of Use</Link>. For
              anything related to your personal data, contact{" "}
              <a href="mailto:privacy@hrvalabs.net">privacy@hrvalabs.net</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>What we collect and why</h2>

            <h3>Account data</h3>
            <p>
              When you register, we process your email address, an optional display name, and your
              password, which is stored only as a salted one-way hash. If you sign in with Google,
              we receive your name and email address from your Google account instead of a
              password. If you enable two-factor authentication, we store the shared secret and
              recovery codes needed to verify your codes. We also record when your account was
              created and when you last logged in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legal basis: performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) — this data is required to
              provide your account.
            </p>

            <h3>Link statistics (visitors who open short links)</h3>
            <p>
              When someone opens a short link, we count the visit and check whether it is a unique
              visitor. To do this, the visitor&apos;s IP address is hashed with a salted one-way
              function the moment it is received — the plain IP address is never written to our
              database. Each hashed record is used for unique-visitor detection for 2 hours and is
              permanently deleted within 48 hours. Link owners only ever see aggregate numbers
              (visit counts and daily unique visitors), never anything about an individual visitor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legal basis: legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) — providing link owners with
              basic, privacy-preserving usage statistics and protecting the service from abuse.
            </p>

            <h3>Storage in your browser</h3>
            <p>
              After you log in, we keep a single authentication token in your browser&apos;s{" "}
              <em>localStorage</em> so you stay signed in. It is strictly necessary to provide the
              service you requested, which is why no consent banner is required for it (Art. 5(3)
              of the ePrivacy Directive, implemented in Croatia by the Electronic Communications
              Act). We set no tracking cookies and use no analytics or advertising scripts. Fonts
              are self-hosted — your browser does not contact third-party font services.
            </p>

            <h3>Emails we send</h3>
            <p>
              We send transactional emails only: address verification, password reset, and
              notifications about your expiring links. We keep a log of emails sent to operate and
              troubleshoot delivery. We do not send marketing email.
            </p>

            <h3>Security and audit logs</h3>
            <p>
              We keep internal audit logs of security-relevant events (such as logins and
              administrative actions) to protect the service and its users. Legal basis:
              legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
            </p>

            <h2>Who else receives data</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Google Sign-In</strong> — only if you choose to log in with Google; Google
                acts as your identity provider under its own privacy policy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Google Safe Browsing</strong> — destination URLs you shorten are checked
                against Google&apos;s threat database to protect visitors from malicious sites. Only
                the URL is sent, never information about you or your visitors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cloudflare</strong> — delivers the web application (hosting/CDN). Your IP
                address reaches Cloudflare as part of normal traffic delivery.
              </li>
              {/* TODO: name the email delivery provider (and its location/safeguards) */}
              <li>
                <strong>Email delivery</strong> — transactional emails are sent via
                [email provider].
              </li>
              {/* TODO: name the backend hosting provider and hosting location */}
              <li>
                <strong>Backend hosting</strong> — the API and database are hosted by
                [hosting provider] in [location].
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We do not sell personal data and we do not share it with anyone beyond the
              processors listed above.
            </p>

            <h2>How long we keep data</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Hashed visitor IPs</strong> — deleted within 48 hours of the visit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Account data</strong> — kept until you delete your account; unused
                accounts are deactivated automatically after a period of inactivity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Password reset tokens</strong> — deleted as soon as they expire.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Your links and their statistics</strong> — kept while your account exists;
                deleting a link also deletes its visit records.
              </li>
              {/* TODO: confirm email/audit log retention period with the backend */}
              <li>
                <strong>Email and audit logs</strong> — kept for [retention period].
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your rights</h2>
            <p>

              your local supervisory authority.

            <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
            <p>
              If we change how we process personal data, we will update this page and the date at
